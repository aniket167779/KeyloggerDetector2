## Keylogger Detector

- A Windows keylogger detector written in python that will check if a possible keylogging related process is running on your computer. It will notify you if a process is suspected of keylogging and will offer you the choice to kill that process.
- This can be experimented with the keylogger repository, that must be turned into an executable.
